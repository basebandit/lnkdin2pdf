## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basebandit/linkedin-to-pdf.git
cd linkedin-to-pdf
```

### 2. Install dependencies

This project uses [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable dependency management. Install it [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

Then run:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Install Playwright browsers (first-time only)

```bash
uv run playwright install chromium
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Convert a single post

```bash
uv run main.py --url https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-1234567890123456789
```

### Convert from a file (CSV or TXT)

```bash
uv run main.py --file posts.csv
```
> File should contain one URL per line (in .txt) or first column only (in .csv)

### Enable debug mode (opens browser, useful for troubleshooting)

```bash
uv run main.py --url https://www.linkedin.com/posts/... --debug
```
